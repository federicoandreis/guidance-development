Terms are organized alphabetically. See the relevant sections for fuller explanations and examples.\n\n---\n\n## A\n\n**Assumption checking**: The process of verifying that your data meets the requirements of a statistical method before applying it. See @sec-z-scoring and @sec-t-tests for method-specific assumptions.\n\n**AQuA Book**: Government guidance on producing robust, fit-for-purpose analysis. The CQC QA Framework aligns with AQuA principles.\n\n---\n\n## B\n\n**Banding**: Grouping providers into performance categories (e.g., significantly above/below average, within expected range) based on statistical analysis. Common in z-scoring applications.\n\n**Bias**: Systematic error that makes results consistently wrong in one direction. Can arise from missing data (MNAR), measurement error, or inappropriate methods.\n\n---\n\n## C\n\n**C-chart**: A control chart for count data (e.g., number of incidents per month). Assumes constant opportunity for events. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Callout box**: Visual elements in this guidance that provide additional context (Rethinking boxes) or technical details (Overthinking boxes).\n\n**Categorical data**: See Qualitative data.\n\n**Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: Statistical principle stating that sample means approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases, even if the underlying data isn't normal. Justifies using methods that assume normality for large samples (typically n ≥ 30). See @sec-statistical-inference.\n\n**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Normalized measure of spread calculated as SD / Mean (often as percentage). Makes variability comparable across different scales or units. Undefined when mean = 0. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Common cause variation**: Random, expected fluctuation in a process. Contrast with special cause variation. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Complete case analysis**: Analyzing only observations with no missing data. Simple but can introduce bias if data is not MCAR. See @sec-missing-data-foundations.\n\n**Confidence interval (CI)**: A range of values likely to contain the true parameter. A 95% CI means if we repeated the analysis many times, 95% of intervals would contain the true value. See @sec-statistical-inference.\n\n**Continuous data**: Quantitative data that can take any value within a range, including decimals (e.g., waiting times, percentages, rates). See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Control chart**: A time-series plot with control limits that signal when a process has changed. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Control limits**: Thresholds on a control chart (typically ±3 standard deviations) that indicate special cause variation. Not the same as specification limits.\n\n**Correlation**: A statistical measure of the relationship between two variables. Ranges from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive). See @sec-correlation.\n\n**Correlation coefficient**: The numerical value (r for Pearson, ρ for Spearman) that quantifies the strength and direction of a correlation. See @sec-correlation.\n\n**CQC Guild** (Data and Insight Quantitative Guild): Internal group providing specialist statistical support and maintaining analytical standards.\n\n---\n\n## D\n\n**Data type**: The nature of your data. Two main categories: Quantitative (continuous or discrete) and Qualitative (nominal or ordinal). Determines which statistical methods are appropriate. See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Discrete data**: Quantitative data that can only take specific values, typically whole numbers (e.g., number of incidents, bed count). See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Distribution**: The pattern of how values are spread out. Common distributions include normal (bell curve), skewed, and uniform.\n\n---\n\n## E\n\n**Effect size**: The magnitude of a difference or relationship, independent of sample size. Examples include Cohen's d for t-tests. See @sec-t-tests.\n\n**Expected value**: The average or predicted value based on a model or national benchmark. Used as the comparison point in z-scoring.\n\n---\n\n## F\n\n**False negative**: Missing a real problem (Type II error). In regulation, failing to identify a poorly performing provider.\n\n**False positive**: Flagging something as a problem when it isn't (Type I error). In regulation, investigating a provider whose performance is actually acceptable.\n\n**Funnel plot**: A scatter plot showing provider performance against sample size, with control limits that widen for smaller samples. Related to z-scoring. See @sec-z-scoring.\n\n---\n\n## G\n\n**Generalized mean** (Power mean): A family of averaging methods that includes arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means as special cases. All are unified by a power parameter *p*. Different values of *p* give different means, each appropriate for different data structures (additive, multiplicative, rates). See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Geometric mean**: A type of generalized mean (*p* → 0). The *n*th root of the product of *n* values. Appropriate for multiplicative processes, growth rates, and ratios. Less sensitive to extreme values than arithmetic mean. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Guild**: See CQC Guild.\n\n---\n\n## H\n\n**Harmonic mean**: A type of generalized mean (*p* = -1). The reciprocal of the average of reciprocals. Appropriate for averaging rates or ratios where denominators vary (e.g., incidents per 1,000 bed-days across providers of different sizes). Gives more weight to smaller values. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n---\n\n## I\n\n**I-chart** (Individuals chart): A control chart for continuous data where each point represents a single measurement. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Indicator**: A metric used to measure provider performance (e.g., waiting times, incident rates, quality scores).\n\n**IQR** (Interquartile Range): The range between the 25th and 75th percentiles (Q3 - Q1). A measure of spread that describes variability without being affected by extreme outliers. Used in outlier detection. See @sec-variation-uncertainty, @sec-unusual-observations, and @sec-outlier-methods.\n\n---\n\n## K\n\n**Kurtosis**: Measure of tail heaviness in a distribution. Kurtosis = 3 for normal distribution. Higher kurtosis indicates heavier tails (more extreme values), lower kurtosis indicates lighter tails. Less commonly used than skewness in CQC work. See @sec-distribution-shape.\n\n---\n\n## M\n\n**MAR** (Missing At Random): Missingness related to observed data but not the missing value itself. Example: smaller providers less likely to report, but missingness doesn't depend on the value being reported. See @sec-missing-data-foundations.\n\n**MCAR** (Missing Completely At Random): Missingness unrelated to any data. Rare in practice but allows simple complete case analysis. See @sec-missing-data-foundations.\n\n**Mean** (Arithmetic mean): A type of generalized mean (*p* = 1). The sum of values divided by count. Most common measure of central tendency. Sensitive to outliers and skewness. Part of the generalized means family. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Median**: The middle value when data is sorted. A quantile—specifically, the 50th percentile (Q2). More robust to outliers than the mean. Works for both quantitative and ordinal data. Part of the quantile family. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Mode**: The most frequently occurring value. The only location measure that works for qualitative (categorical) data. Can be bimodal (two modes) or multimodal (multiple modes). See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Mahalanobis distance**: A multivariate measure of how far an observation is from the center of a distribution, accounting for correlations between variables. Used in multivariate outlier detection. See @sec-outlier-methods.\n\n**Modified z-score**: A robust alternative to z-scores that uses median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of mean and standard deviation. Less influenced by outliers themselves. See @sec-outlier-methods.\n\n**MNAR** (Missing Not At Random): Missingness related to the unobserved value itself. Example: poor performers don't report. Creates serious bias. See @sec-missing-data-foundations and @sec-missing-data-handling.\n\n**Multiple Imputation (MI)**: Advanced method for handling missing data by creating multiple plausible complete datasets. Requires specialist implementation. See @sec-missing-data-handling.\n\n---\n\n## N\n\n**Normal distribution**: A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution. Many statistical methods assume approximate normality. Also called Gaussian distribution.\n\n---\n\n## O\n\n**Nominal data**: Qualitative data with no natural order between categories (e.g., provider type, region, incident category). See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Numerical data**: See Quantitative data.\n\n**Ordinal data**: Qualitative data with a natural order between categories, but unequal distances between them (e.g., CQC ratings: Outstanding > Good > Requires Improvement > Inadequate). See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Outlier**: A value far from the rest of the data. May be an error, a genuine extreme value, or indicate a different population. No universal definition—context determines what's \"unusual.\" See @sec-unusual-observations and @sec-outlier-methods.\n\n**Overdispersion**: When data shows more variation than expected by the statistical model. Common in count data. Requires adjustment in z-scoring. See @sec-z-scoring.\n\n**Overthinking box**: Callout boxes (yellow/orange) containing technical details, edge cases, and when to escalate to the Guild. Optional reading for most analysts.\n\n---\n\n## P\n\n**P-chart**: A control chart for proportions (e.g., percentage of patients meeting a target). See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**P-value**: The probability of observing data as extreme as yours if there's no real effect. Not the probability that the null hypothesis is true. See @sec-t-tests.\n\n**Pearson's correlation (r)**: Measures the strength of linear relationships between continuous variables. Assumes normality and is sensitive to outliers. See @sec-correlation.\n\n**Penny Dash review**: 2024 review of CQC's analytical quality, which found variable standards and led to the QA Framework. See @sec-qa-principles.\n\n**Percentile**: A type of quantile that divides data into 100 groups. The 90th percentile means 90% of values are below this point. Used for ranking providers and setting thresholds. Part of the quantile family (which includes median, quartiles, deciles). See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Power** (Statistical power): The probability of detecting a real effect. Depends on sample size, effect size, and significance level. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Provider**: A healthcare organization regulated by CQC (e.g., hospital, care home, GP practice).\n\n---\n\n## Q\n\n**QA Framework** (Quantitative Analytics and Statistics Quality Assurance Framework): CQC's internal framework for ensuring analytical quality. Structured around five key questions spanning the analytical lifecycle. Aligns with the AQuA Book. See @sec-qa-principles.\n\n**Qualitative data**: Data representing categories or qualities, not quantities. Cannot perform meaningful arithmetic. Two types: Nominal (no order) and Ordinal (ordered categories). Also called categorical data. See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Quantile**: A family of position-based measures that divide data into equal-sized groups. All quantiles answer \"where does this value sit in the distribution?\" Types include: percentiles (100 groups), quartiles (4 groups), quintiles (5 groups), deciles (10 groups), and median (50th percentile). Differ only in how finely you divide the data. Work for both quantitative and ordinal data (only require ordering, not arithmetic). Used for ranking and position-based comparisons. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Quantitative data**: Data representing measurable quantities or amounts. Can perform arithmetic operations. Two types: Continuous (any value in range) and Discrete (whole numbers only). Also called numerical data. See @sec-data-types.\n\n**Quartile**: A type of quantile that divides data into 4 groups. Q1 (25th percentile), Q2 (median/50th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile). Used for creating performance bands and identifying which quarter of the distribution a provider falls into. Part of the quantile family. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n---\n\n## R\n\n**Rethinking box**: Callout boxes (blue) providing CQC context, professional judgment guidance, and regulatory considerations.\n\n---\n\n## S\n\n**Sample size**: The number of observations. Larger samples give more precise estimates but don't guarantee practical importance.\n\n**Sensitivity analysis**: Testing how results change when you vary assumptions or methods. Essential for understanding robustness.\n\n**Shannon's Entropy (H)**: Measure of diversity or heterogeneity in categorical data. H = 0 when all observations in one category, H = log₂(k) for uniform distribution across k categories. Higher values indicate more diversity. Works for nominal data. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Significance level**: The threshold for declaring a result statistically significant (commonly 0.05). Represents acceptable false positive rate.\n\n**Simpson's Diversity Index (D)**: Probability that two randomly selected observations are from different categories. D = 0 when all in one category, D = (k-1)/k for uniform distribution. Measures heterogeneity in nominal data. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Skewness**: Asymmetry in a distribution. Positive skew has a long right tail; negative skew has a long left tail. See @sec-distribution-shape.\n\n**Spearman's correlation (ρ)**: Rank-based correlation measure. More robust to outliers and non-linear relationships than Pearson's r. See @sec-correlation.\n\n**Special cause variation**: Non-random change in a process that warrants investigation. Contrast with common cause variation. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**SPC** (Statistical Process Control): Methods for monitoring processes over time to detect genuine changes. See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Standard deviation (SD)**: A measure of spread that quantifies the average distance of values from the mean. In original units (e.g., hours, incidents). Related to variance by SD = √variance. Used in z-scoring and control charts. Works for quantitative data only. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Standard error (SE)**: The standard deviation of a sample statistic (e.g., mean). Decreases with larger sample size.\n\n**Standardization**: Transforming data to a common scale for comparison. Z-scoring is a form of standardization.\n\n---\n\n## T\n\n**t-test**: A statistical test comparing means between groups or against a target. Appropriate for small samples or when population SD is unknown. See @sec-t-tests.\n\n**Threshold**: A cut-off value for decision-making. This guidance emphasizes investigation over mechanical thresholds.\n\n**Tukey's fences**: A rule for identifying potential outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR). Values beyond 1.5 × IQR from the first or third quartile are flagged. The rule box plots use. See @sec-unusual-observations and @sec-outlier-methods.\n\n**Type I error**: False positive. Rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n\n**Type II error**: False negative. Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n## U\n\n**U-chart**: A control chart for rates (counts per unit, e.g., incidents per 1000 bed days). See @sec-spc-basics.\n\n**Uncertainty**: The range of plausible values for a parameter. Quantified by confidence intervals or standard errors. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Unusual observation**: A value that stands out from the rest of the data. Preferred term to \"outlier\" because it acknowledges there's no universal definition—what's unusual depends on context, question, and method. See @sec-unusual-observations.\n\n**Upset plot**: A visualization for exploring patterns of missingness across multiple variables. Shows which variables are missing together, revealing patterns that simple percentages might miss. See @sec-missing-data-handling.\n\n---\n\n## V\n\n**Variance**: A measure of spread equal to the square of the standard deviation (variance = SD²). In squared units (e.g., hours², incidents²), making it less interpretable than SD but mathematically convenient for many statistical methods. SD and variance are the same measure related by a monotonic transformation. Works for quantitative data only. See @sec-variation-uncertainty.\n\n**Variation**: Differences between observations. Can be expected (common cause) or signal a change (special cause). Understanding variation is central to statistical thinking. See @sec-variation-uncertainty and @sec-spc-basics.\n\n---\n\n## W\n\n**Weighted mean** (Weighted average): A type of generalized mean where different values have different importance (weights). Used when aggregating across providers of different sizes or with different precision. Common weights include provider size (bed-days, patient count) for patient-centered metrics, or inverse variance for combining uncertain estimates. Part of the generalized means family. See @sec-describing-data.\n\n**Working z-score**: An extension of standard z-scoring for data that doesn't meet normality assumptions. Uses the exact distribution (Beta, Poisson, etc.). Requires specialist implementation. See @sec-z-scoring.\n\n---\n\n## Z\n\n**z-score**: A standardized measure of how far an observation is from the expected value, in standard deviation units. CQC's primary method for provider comparison. See @sec-z-scoring.\n\n**z-test**: A statistical test that assumes known population standard deviation. At CQC, z-scoring (for provider comparison) is more common than z-tests (for hypothesis testing).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"glossary.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["../references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","number-depth":2,"title":"Glossary"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
