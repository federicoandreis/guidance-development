Is this a real problem or chance variation? Should you investigate?\n\n**Statistical inference** provides structured ways to move from observed data (your sample) to conclusions about the broader reality (the population), while quantifying uncertainty.\n\n**This chapter covers**: Population vs sample, estimation (point and interval), hypothesis testing, and practical application to CQC work.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Rethinking: Exploratory vs Confirmatory Analysis\n\nMost CQC analysis is **exploratory**: we use data to understand patterns and guide decisions, not to provide definitive proof.\n\n**Exploratory** (most CQC work):\n- Flexible, iterative process\n- Data guides analytical decisions (transformations, outlier handling)\n- Results suggest where to investigate\n- Example: Profiling provider performance to prioritize inspections\n\n**Confirmatory** (rare at CQC):\n- Study design and analysis plan fully specified before data collection\n- No peeking at data to guide decisions\n- Formal statistical inference is strictly valid\n- Example: Pre-registered evaluation of an intervention\n\n**Why this matters**: Formal inference assumes confirmatory analysis. In exploratory work, p-values and CIs are optimistic—they don't account for all your data-driven decisions.\n\n**CQC practice**: Treat most analyses as exploratory. Use statistics to **guide investigation**, not as definitive proof. Look for patterns across multiple sources. Statistical flagging is one input among many (clinical judgment, inspection history, context).\n:::\n\n## Population, Sample, and Estimation\n\n### The Fundamental Problem\n\n**Population**: The complete set you care about (all care homes in England, a provider's true underlying incident rate).\n\n**Sample**: The subset you actually observe (200 care homes you collected data from, incidents observed in past 6 months).\n\n**The problem**: You observe a sample but want to know about the population.\n\n**The solution**: Use the sample to estimate population parameters, while acknowledging uncertainty.\n\n### Point and Interval Estimation\n\n**Point estimate**: A single number as your best guess of the population parameter.\n- Sample mean waiting time = 3.2 hours → estimates population mean\n- Sample incident rate = 45 per 1,000 bed-days → estimates provider's true rate\n\n**Confidence interval (CI)**: A range of plausible values for the population parameter.\n- **95% CI**: If we repeated this analysis many times, 95% of intervals would contain the true value\n- **Practical interpretation**: We're 95% confident the true value is in this range\n\n**Example**: Provider's incident rate = 45 per 1,000 bed-days (95% CI: 38-52)\n- Point estimate: 45\n- Plausible range: 38 to 52\n- We're 95% confident the true rate is between 38 and 52\n\n**What determines CI width**:\n- **Sample size**: Larger sample → narrower CI (more precise)\n- **Variability**: Higher SD → wider CI (more uncertainty)\n- **Confidence level**: 99% CI wider than 95% CI\n\n**CQC implication**: Small providers have wide CIs. This doesn't mean ignore them—interpret their estimates with appropriate caution.\n\n**The uncertainty paradox**: A small provider with a high incident rate might not be statistically flagged (wide CI includes the benchmark). But from a regulatory perspective, potential harm exists even if uncertain. **Statistical significance ≠ regulatory priority.**\n\n## Hypothesis Testing\n\n### The Three-Step Logic\n\nHypothesis testing asks: \"Are our data surprising enough to conclude something is happening?\"\n\n**Step 1: State the null hypothesis (H₀)**—Assume nothing special is happening.\n\nExamples: This care home's true rate = national average; the intervention made no difference; urban and rural practices have equal scores.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the p-value**—If H₀ were true, how likely would we see data this extreme?\n\n**Step 3: Decide**—If the data would be very surprising under H₀ (small p-value), conclude something probably is happening. If not surprising (large p-value), you can't rule out chance.\n\n### Understanding p-values\n\n**Definition**: The probability of seeing data this extreme (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true.\n\n**Plain English**: \"If this provider were actually average, how surprised should we be by what we observed?\"\n\n**Example**: p = 0.03 means \"If the provider's true rate equals the national average, there's only a 3% chance we'd see a difference this large from random variation alone.\"\n\n**What p-values are NOT**:\n- NOT the probability the null hypothesis is true\n- NOT the probability the result is due to chance\n- NOT a measure of effect size or importance\n- NOT proof of causation\n\n### The 0.05 Threshold\n\n**Convention**: p < 0.05 often used as \"statistical significance.\"\n\n**What this means**: We accept a 5% false positive rate—flagging providers as concerning when they're actually fine.\n\n**Critical point**: 0.05 is arbitrary, from Ronald Fisher (1925), not a law of nature.\n\n**CQC practice—choose thresholds based on context**:\n\n| Context | Recommended Threshold | Rationale |\n|---------|----------------------|-----------|\n| **High-stakes decisions** (enforcement) | 0.01 or 0.001 | Minimize false positives, higher evidence bar |\n| **Screening for inspection** (initial flagging) | 0.10 or 0.20 | Catch more potential issues, investigation will confirm |\n| **Exploratory analysis** (patterns) | No fixed threshold | Look at effect sizes and CIs, not just p-values |\n\n**Important**: p = 0.049 and p = 0.051 differ trivially. Treat 0.05 as a guideline, not a cliff edge.\n\n## Statistical vs Practical Significance and Effect Sizes\n\n### The Critical Distinction\n\n**Statistical significance**: The result is unlikely due to chance alone (typically p < 0.05). Tells you there's probably a real difference.\n\n**Practical significance**: The effect size is large enough to matter in the real world. Tells you whether the difference is meaningful for decisions.\n\n**They're different things. Always report both.**\n\n### The Sample Size Problem\n\n| Scenario | What Happens | Example |\n|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **Large sample, small effect** | Statistically significant BUT practically trivial | 10,000 providers: 0.2% difference (p < 0.05) but only 1 extra incident per 500 bed-days per year |\n| **Small sample, large effect** | Not statistically significant BUT practically important | 10 providers: 25% difference (p > 0.05) but large enough to investigate regardless |\n\n**Lesson**: Statistical significance gets you in the door. Practical significance tells you whether to walk through it.\n\n### Effect Size Measures\n\n**Cohen's d** (standardized mean difference): Difference / pooled SD\n\n| Cohen's d | Interpretation |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| < 0.2 | Negligible |\n| 0.2 - 0.5 | Small |\n| 0.5 - 0.8 | Medium |\n| > 0.8 | Large |\n\n**Example**: Two regions differ in wait times by 2 hours. Is that large?\n- If SD = 1 hour → d = 2.0 (very large)\n- If SD = 10 hours → d = 0.2 (small)\n\n**Other measures**:\n- **Absolute difference**: Raw difference (e.g., 7.5 points on 0-100 scale). Easy to interpret but doesn't account for variability.\n- **Percentage difference**: Relative change (e.g., 30% reduction). Intuitive but misleading with small baselines.\n\n**CQC practice**: Report both absolute differences (operational context) and standardized effect sizes (comparison across indicators).\n\n### Why Confidence Intervals Are Better Than p-values Alone\n\nCIs tell you two things at once:\n1. **Statistical significance**: Does the interval exclude the null value (e.g., 0)?\n2. **Practical significance**: What's the plausible range of effects?\n\n**Example comparisons**:\n\n| Confidence Interval | Interpretation |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| [5.8, 9.2] | Significant (excludes 0) AND large effect |\n| [0.1, 0.3] | Significant (excludes 0) BUT tiny effect |\n| [-2.0, 8.0] | Not significant (includes 0) BUT could be large effect |\n\n**CQC practice**: Always report CIs alongside p-values. Stakeholders understand \"the true difference is probably between X and Y\" better than \"p = 0.03.\"\n\n## False Positives vs False Negatives\n\nIn regulation, we face a trade-off between two types of errors:\n\n| Error Type | Definition | Consequence | Controlled By |\n|------------|------------|-------------|---------------|\n| **False Positive** (Type I) | Flagging a provider as concerning when they're actually fine | Wasted resources, unfair to provider, reputational damage | Significance level (typically 5%) |\n| **False Negative** (Type II) | Missing a provider who actually has problems | Patients at risk, regulatory failure | Statistical power (sample size, effect size) |\n\n**The trade-off**: Stricter thresholds reduce false positives but increase false negatives. Lenient thresholds reduce false negatives but increase false positives.\n\n**CQC context**: We typically prioritize avoiding false negatives (missing real problems) over avoiding false positives (investigating providers who turn out fine). This affects how we set thresholds.\n\nThis doesn't mean ignoring false positives—they waste inspection capacity and can damage provider reputation. But it does mean accepting higher false positive rates than academic research would.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Rethinking: Regulatory vs Research Priorities\n\nAcademic research and regulation have different priorities.\n\n**Research context**: False positives mislead the field. Use strict thresholds (p < 0.05, often p < 0.01).\n\n**Regulatory context**: Missing serious problems (false negative) can harm patients. Investigating a provider who turns out fine (false positive) wastes resources but doesn't directly harm patients.\n\n**CQC practice**: Document your threshold choice and rationale. For high-stakes indicators (patient safety), accept 10-20% false positives to catch more true problems. For lower-stakes indicators (patient experience), use stricter thresholds.\n\n**This is professional judgment, not mechanical application of \"p < 0.05.\"**\n:::\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n| Pitfall | Wrong Interpretation | Correct Interpretation | What to Do |\n|---------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| **p > 0.05 means no difference** | Absence of evidence = evidence of absence | Insufficient evidence to conclude there's a difference. Could mean: no difference exists, sample too small, or difference smaller than detectable. | Report the CI. Wide CI = high uncertainty. |\n| **p < 0.05 proves causation** | Statistical significance = proof of cause and effect | We've detected an association. Causation requires temporal sequence, plausible mechanism, ruling out confounders. | Most CQC analyses are observational. Identify concerning patterns that warrant investigation, not proof. |\n| **0.049 vs 0.051 is meaningful** | 0.05 is a hard boundary | The difference is trivial. Both indicate moderate evidence. | Report exact p-value. Interpret as continuous evidence, not binary. |\n| **Multiple testing without adjustment** | Test 20 hypotheses at p < 0.05 with no correction | Expect 1 false positive even if nothing is happening. | For routine comparisons: accept some false positives (investigation confirms). For high-stakes: use Bonferroni or stricter thresholds. |\n\n## Reporting Results Correctly\n\n### What to Always Include\n\nEvery statistical result should report:\n\n1. **Sample sizes** for all groups\n2. **Effect estimate** (mean difference, proportion difference)\n3. **Confidence interval** (95% CI)\n4. **p-value** (exact value, not just \"p < 0.05\")\n5. **Effect size** (Cohen's d or equivalent)\n6. **Interpretation** (statistical and practical significance)\n7. **Limitations** (sample size, generalizability, confounders)\n\n### Good vs Bad Examples\n\n**Good**:\n> \"Pilot practices (n=10) scored 7.5 points higher than controls (n=10) on average (95% CI: 5.8 to 9.2, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 4.06). This represents a large and operationally meaningful improvement on the 0-100 scale. Small sample size (n=10 per group) limits generalizability. No information on whether improvements persist over time.\"\n\n**Bad**:\n> \"Pilot practices scored significantly higher (p < 0.05).\"\n\n### Communicating to Stakeholders\n\n| Instead of | Use |\n|------------|-----|\n| \"Statistically significant at p < 0.05\" | \"Very unlikely to be due to chance alone\" |\n| Leading with p-value | \"The pilot improved scores by 7.5 points on average—a meaningful improvement. This is very unlikely to be due to chance (p < 0.001).\" |\n| Point estimate only | \"The true improvement is probably between 5.8 and 9.2 points (95% confidence interval).\" |\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n## Overthinking: Statistical Power\n\n**Statistical power**: The probability of detecting a real effect when it exists (avoiding false negatives).\n\n**Power depends on**:\n- Sample size: Larger = more power\n- Effect size: Larger = more power\n- Significance level: Stricter (p < 0.01 vs p < 0.05) = less power\n- Variability: Lower SD = more power\n\n**CQC context for small providers**:\n- **If flagged**: Take seriously (detected despite low power → strong signal)\n- **If not flagged**: Can't conclude they're fine (might have missed a problem)\n\n**Asymmetry**: Statistical methods better at detecting problems in large providers (high power) than small providers (low power). This doesn't mean small providers are safer—it means our detection ability is limited.\n\n**When to calculate power**: Before designing a new indicator. Ask: \"Will we have enough data to detect meaningful differences?\"\n\n**When to escalate**: If designing a new indicator and unsure about power calculations, consult the Quantitative Guild.\n:::\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n## Essential Points\n\n1. **Most CQC work is exploratory**: Use statistics to guide investigation, not as definitive proof. Look for patterns across multiple sources.\n\n2. **Samples estimate populations**: We observe samples but want to know about populations. CIs quantify uncertainty.\n\n3. **Sample size governs precision**: Larger samples → narrower CIs → more precise estimates. Small providers have high uncertainty.\n\n4. **p-values are probabilities of data**: p = 0.03 means data unlikely under null, NOT null hypothesis 97% false.\n\n5. **0.05 is a guideline, not law**: Choose thresholds based on decision context (high-stakes: 0.01; screening: 0.10-0.20).\n\n6. **Statistical ≠ practical significance**: Always evaluate both. Large samples make tiny effects significant; small samples make large effects non-significant.\n\n7. **Report effect sizes**: Show magnitude independent of sample size. Essential for practical interpretation.\n\n8. **CIs better than p-values alone**: Show both significance and magnitude in one summary.\n\n9. **False positive/negative trade-off**: In regulation, prioritize avoiding false negatives (missing problems) over false positives (wasteful investigations).\n\n10. **Report completely**: Sample sizes, estimates, CIs, p-values, effect sizes, interpretations, limitations.\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"09-statistical-inference.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["../references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","number-depth":2,"title":"Statistical Inference"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
