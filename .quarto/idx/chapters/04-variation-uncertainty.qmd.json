This chapter tells you how spread out your data is around that middle.\n\nTwo providers might both have a mean incident rate of 10 per month, but one consistently records 9-11 incidents (low variation), while the other swings from 0-20 (high variation). This distinction matters for regulation.\n\n**Why measuring variation matters**:\n\n- **Consistency vs volatility**: Low variation suggests stable processes, high variation suggests inconsistent performance\n- **Comparison context**: A provider 5 incidents above the mean is more concerning if typical variation is ±2 than if it's ±10\n- **Method selection**: Different measures suit different data types (quantitative vs qualitative)\n- **Outlier detection**: You need to know typical spread to identify unusual values\n\n**Building on Chapter 3**: You know where your data sits (location). This chapter quantifies how variable it is (spread).\n\n## Variation in Quantitative Data\n\nQuantitative data (continuous and discrete) requires measures that use arithmetic. The most common are standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range.\n\n### Standard Deviation and Variance\n\n**Standard deviation (SD)** and **variance** are the same measure, related by a monotonic transformation: variance = SD². They quantify average distance from the mean.\n\n**Key distinction**: Units of measurement and interpretability.\n\n- **Variance**: Squared units (e.g., hours², incidents²). Mathematically convenient but hard to interpret.\n- **Standard deviation**: Original units (e.g., hours, incidents). Easy to interpret: \"typical distance from mean.\"\n\n**When to report which**:\n- **SD for interpretation**: \"The standard deviation is 2.5 hours, so most practices are within 2.5 hours of the mean.\"\n- **Variance for calculations**: Many statistical methods (t-tests, ANOVA, regression) work with variance internally.\n- **Both are the same information**: If you have one, you have the other. Don't treat them as different measures.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- Low SD/variance: Data clustered tightly around mean, consistent performance\n- High SD/variance: Data spread out, variable performance\n- Example: Mean waiting time = 3.2 hours, SD = 0.8 hours → most practices are between 2.4 and 4.0 hours\n\n**Why SD/variance matters**:\n- **Z-scoring** (@sec-z-scoring): Quantifies how many SDs a provider is from the mean\n- **Control limits in SPC** (@sec-spc-basics): Typically set at ±3 SD from mean\n- **Comparing providers**: A provider 1 SD above mean in a low-SD indicator is more unusual than 1 SD above mean in a high-SD indicator\n\n**CQC context**: SD tells you how much natural variation exists across providers. If the SD of incident rates is large, providers naturally vary a lot. If it's small, any deviation is more notable.\n\n### Interquartile Range: Robust to Outliers\n\n**Interquartile range (IQR)** is the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles (Q3 - Q1). It describes the spread of the middle 50% of your data.\n\n**Why use IQR instead of SD**:\n- **Robust to outliers**: Extreme values don't affect it\n- **Works with skewed data**: Doesn't assume symmetry\n- **Easy to communicate**: \"The middle half of providers span this range\"\n\n**When to use**:\n- Skewed data where SD is inflated by outliers\n- Reporting spread to non-technical audiences\n- Box plots (which display IQR visually)\n\n**Example**: IQR = 1.5 hours means the middle 50% of practices have waiting times within a 1.5-hour range. Whether the extreme tail extends to 10 hours or 100 hours doesn't affect this.\n\n**SD vs IQR**: \n- SD uses all data, more efficient with symmetric data\n- IQR ignores tails, more robust with skewed data or outliers\n- Report both when data is skewed\n\n### Range and Percentile-Based Measures\n\n**Range**: Maximum - Minimum. Simple but heavily influenced by outliers. Rarely useful for CQC work.\n\n**Percentile ranges**: Distance between any two percentiles (e.g., 10th to 90th). More robust than full range.\n\n- **80% range** (P10 to P90): Excludes extreme 10% at each tail\n- **90% range** (P5 to P95): Excludes extreme 5% at each tail\n\n**When to use**: Describing spread while excluding extreme outliers, especially for skewed distributions.\n\n### Coefficient of Variation: Comparing Across Scales\n\n**Coefficient of Variation (CV)** normalizes SD to make variability comparable across different scales or units.\n\n**Definition**: CV = SD / Mean (often expressed as percentage)\n\n**Why use CV**:\n- **Compare different indicators**: \"Which is more variable, waiting times or incident rates?\"\n- **Compare different scales**: Providers with very different baseline levels\n- **Assess scaling**: Does variability increase proportionally with the mean?\n\n**Example**:\n- Waiting times: Mean = 3 hours, SD = 0.6 hours → CV = 20%\n- Incident rates: Mean = 15 per month, SD = 3 per month → CV = 20%\n\nBoth have the same relative variability (20%), even though raw SDs differ.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- Low CV (< 15%): Low relative variability, consistent performance\n- Moderate CV (15-30%): Moderate relative variability\n- High CV (> 30%): High relative variability, inconsistent performance\n\n**Limitations**:\n- Undefined when mean = 0\n- Unstable when mean is close to 0\n- Requires ratio scale (meaningful zero point)\n- Only works for quantitative data\n\n### Summary: Quantitative Variation Measures\n\n| Measure | Calculation | When to Use | Strengths | Limitations |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|\n| **SD/Variance** | Average distance from mean (variance = SD²) | Symmetric data, statistical methods | Uses all data, efficient | Sensitive to outliers, inflated by skewness |\n| **IQR** | Q3 - Q1 | Skewed data, outliers present | Robust to extremes | Ignores tails, less efficient |\n| **Range** | Max - Min | Quick check only | Simple | Heavily influenced by extremes |\n| **Percentile ranges** | P90 - P10, etc. | Skewed data, excluding extremes | Customizable robustness | Arbitrary percentile choice |\n| **CV** | SD / Mean (%) | Comparing across scales | Normalized, comparable | Unstable near zero, ratio scale only |\n\n## Variation in Ordinal Data\n\nOrdinal data (ordered categories) can use quantile-based measures but not arithmetic-based measures.\n\n### What Works for Ordinal Data\n\n**IQR and percentile ranges**: These only require ordering, not arithmetic.\n\n- Example: CQC ratings (Inadequate < Requires Improvement < Good < Outstanding)\n- Can calculate: Median rating, IQR of ratings, percentage in each category\n- Cannot calculate: Mean rating, SD of ratings (no meaningful arithmetic)\n\n**Percentage in each category**: Simple and interpretable.\n\n- Example: \"60% of providers are Good, 30% Outstanding, 10% Requires Improvement\"\n- Shows distribution without assuming equal spacing between categories\n\n### What Doesn't Work for Ordinal Data\n\n**SD and variance**: Require arithmetic operations. You cannot calculate a meaningful \"average distance\" from a mean rating when the spacing between categories is undefined.\n\n**Don't do this**: Assign numbers (1=Inadequate, 2=Requires Improvement, 3=Good, 4=Outstanding) and calculate SD. The numbers are arbitrary—why not 1, 2, 4, 10? Different numbering gives different SDs, making it meaningless.\n\n## Variation in Nominal Data\n\nNominal data (unordered categories) cannot use quantiles or arithmetic. You need heterogeneity measures.\n\n### Heterogeneity Measures for Categorical Data\n\n**Proportion in largest category**: Simple measure of concentration.\n\n- If 90% of providers are in one category, low heterogeneity (homogeneous)\n- If categories are evenly split, high heterogeneity (diverse)\n\n**Shannon's Entropy (H)**: Measures uncertainty or diversity in categorical data.\n\n$$H = -\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \\log_2(p_i)$$\n\nWhere *p*ᵢ is the proportion in category *i*, and *k* is the number of categories.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- H = 0: All observations in one category (no diversity)\n- H = log₂(k): Perfectly uniform distribution (maximum diversity)\n- Higher H = more heterogeneous/diverse\n\n**Example**: Provider types across a region\n- 100% hospitals: H = 0 (no diversity)\n- 50% hospitals, 50% care homes: H = 1.0\n- 25% each of 4 types: H = 2.0 (maximum for 4 categories)\n\n**CQC use cases**:\n- Measuring diversity of provider types in a region\n- Quantifying heterogeneity of incident categories\n- Comparing diversity across regions or time periods\n\n**Simpson's Diversity Index (D)**: Probability that two randomly selected observations are from different categories.\n\n$$D = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i^2$$\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- D = 0: All observations in one category (no diversity)\n- D = (k-1)/k: Perfectly uniform distribution (maximum diversity)\n- Higher D = more diverse\n\n**Example**: Same provider type data\n- 100% hospitals: D = 0\n- 50% hospitals, 50% care homes: D = 0.5\n- 25% each of 4 types: D = 0.75\n\n**When to use which**:\n- **Shannon's Entropy**: More sensitive to rare categories, commonly used in ecology and information theory\n- **Simpson's Index**: More intuitive interpretation (probability of difference), less sensitive to rare categories\n- **Both are valid**: Choose based on audience and context\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n## Rethinking: Why Heterogeneity Matters for Regulation\n\nHeterogeneity in categorical variables affects how you interpret performance data.\n\n**Example 1: Incident categories**\n- Low heterogeneity (90% medication errors): Suggests a specific, targetable problem\n- High heterogeneity (evenly split across 10 categories): Suggests systemic quality issues, harder to target\n\n**Example 2: Provider types in a region**\n- Low heterogeneity (all care homes): Simpler to benchmark and compare\n- High heterogeneity (hospitals, care homes, GP practices, hospices): Need stratified analysis, harder to create fair comparisons\n\n**Example 3: CQC ratings over time**\n- Increasing heterogeneity: System becoming more variable, some improving while others decline\n- Decreasing heterogeneity: System converging, either improving together or declining together\n\nMeasuring heterogeneity helps you understand whether variation is concentrated in specific areas (targetable) or diffuse across many dimensions (systemic).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n## Overthinking: Other Normalized Measures\n\nBeyond CV, other normalized measures exist for specific contexts.\n\n### Quartile Coefficient of Dispersion (QCD)\n\n**Definition**: QCD = (Q3 - Q1) / (Q3 + Q1)\n\n**Purpose**: Normalized version of IQR, comparable across scales.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- QCD = 0: No spread (all values equal)\n- QCD = 1: Maximum theoretical spread\n- Higher QCD = more relative variability\n\n**When to use**:\n- Comparing IQR-based spread across different scales\n- When data is skewed (CV not appropriate)\n- When you want a robust, normalized dispersion measure\n\n### Normalized Entropy\n\n**Definition**: H_norm = H / log₂(k), where k = number of categories\n\n**Purpose**: Makes Shannon's Entropy comparable across variables with different numbers of categories.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- H_norm = 0: All observations in one category\n- H_norm = 1: Perfectly uniform distribution\n- Scale: Always between 0 and 1, regardless of number of categories\n\n**When to use**:\n- Comparing heterogeneity across categorical variables with different numbers of categories\n- Example: Comparing diversity of incident types (10 categories) vs provider types (4 categories)\n\n### When Normalization Matters\n\n**Comparing across indicators**: \"Is waiting time more variable than incident rates?\" requires normalized measures (CV, QCD).\n\n**Comparing across time**: If the mean changes over time, raw SD changes too. CV shows whether relative variability changed.\n\n**Comparing across regions**: If regions have different baseline levels, normalized measures show whether relative variability differs.\n\n**When to escalate**: If you're unsure which normalization is appropriate for your comparison, or if stakeholders are confused by normalized measures, consult the Quantitative Guild.\n:::\n\n## Choosing the Right Measure\n\nMatch your variation measure to your data type and analytical question.\n\n### By Data Type\n\n| Data Type | Appropriate Measures | Inappropriate Measures |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| **Continuous** | SD, variance, IQR, range | Entropy, Simpson's Index |\n| **Discrete** | SD, variance, IQR, range | Entropy, Simpson's Index |\n| **Ordinal** | IQR, percentile ranges, % in each category | SD, variance (no meaningful arithmetic) |\n| **Nominal** | Entropy, Simpson's Index, % in largest category | SD, variance, IQR (no ordering) |\n\n### By Data Characteristics\n\n| Characteristic | Preferred Measure | Why |\n|----------------|-------------------|-----|\n| **Symmetric, no outliers** | SD, variance, CV | Most efficient, uses all data |\n| **Outliers present** | IQR, percentile ranges, QCD | Robust to extremes |\n| **Comparing scales** | CV, QCD | Normalized measures needed |\n| **Small sample** | IQR | Less sensitive to sampling variability |\n\n### By Purpose\n\n| Purpose | Recommended Measure | Example |\n|---------|---------------------|---------|\n| **Statistical methods** | SD, variance | Input for z-scoring, t-tests, SPC |\n| **Robust description** | IQR | Reporting to stakeholders, skewed data |\n| **Comparing scales** | CV, QCD | \"Which indicator is more variable?\" |\n| **Categorical diversity** | Entropy, Simpson's Index | \"How diverse are incident types?\" |\n| **Simple communication** | Range, IQR | Non-technical audiences |\n\n## Visualizing Variation\n\nSummary statistics are essential, but visualization reveals patterns numbers alone might miss.\n\n**Histogram**: Shows distribution shape and outliers.\n\n- Good for: Understanding distribution shape before choosing methods\n- Reveals: Multimodality, outliers, gaps in data\n\n**Box plot**: Shows median, quartiles (IQR), and outliers in a compact format.\n\n- Good for: Comparing multiple groups side-by-side\n- Reveals: Differences in central tendency, spread, and outliers across groups\n\n**Violin plot**: Combines box plot with density plot, showing full distribution shape.\n\n- Good for: Seeing distribution shape while comparing groups\n- Reveals: Multimodality and density patterns\n\n**Scatter plot**: Shows relationship between two variables.\n\n- Good for: Exploring whether variables are related\n- Reveals: Linear vs nonlinear relationships, clustering, outliers\n\nAlways visualize your data before applying statistical methods. Patterns obvious in plots might not be obvious in summary statistics.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false}\n## Essential Points\n\n1. **Variation is not one thing**: Different data types require different measures. Quantitative → SD/IQR/CV. Ordinal → IQR only. Nominal → Entropy/Simpson's Index.\n\n2. **SD and variance are the same measure**: Related by variance = SD². Use SD for interpretation (original units), variance for calculations (mathematical convenience). Don't treat them as different.\n\n3. **Match measure to data characteristics**: SD for symmetric data without outliers, IQR when outliers present or sample is small.\n\n4. **CV normalizes for scale**: Use CV when comparing variability across different indicators or scales. Makes relative variability comparable.\n\n5. **Ordinal ≠ quantitative**: You can calculate IQR for ordinal data (only needs ordering), but not SD (requires arithmetic). Don't assign arbitrary numbers to categories and calculate SD.\n\n6. **Categorical data needs heterogeneity measures**: Shannon's Entropy and Simpson's Index quantify diversity in nominal data. Higher values = more heterogeneous.\n\n7. **Choose absolute or relative**: Raw measures (SD, IQR) show absolute spread. Normalized measures (CV, QCD) show relative spread. Use relative when comparing across scales.\n\n8. **Visualize before you analyze**: Plots reveal distribution shape, outliers, and patterns that summary statistics might miss.\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"04-variation-uncertainty.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["../references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","number-depth":2,"title":"Measuring Variation"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
