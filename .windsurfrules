# CQC Statistical Guidance Book – Core Rules

Purpose: Minimal rules for Windsurf.  
Detailed guidance lives in docs/project-docs:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- CONTENT_DETAILS.md
- PROJECT_RULES.md (if present)
- QUARTO_CONFIG.md
- QUICK_START.md
- guidance.md

## 1. Content Philosophy

- **Teach judgment, not rules**  
  No mechanical thresholds (e.g. “if >10% missing…”). Show reasoning, options, and trade‑offs.
- **Questions first, methods second**  
  Structure sections around analyst questions, not theory.
- **Respect complexity**  
  Acknowledge uncertainty, assumptions, and regulatory trade‑offs.
- **Multiple valid approaches**  
  Present options with pros/cons; justify choices.
- **Real CQC context**  
  Use realistic CQC indicators and scenarios, not textbook datasets.

---

## 2. Structure Requirements

- **Three-layer approach**  
  Main text + “Rethinking” boxes + “Overthinking” boxes.
- **Independent methods sections**  
  Each methods section must be usable on its own.
- **Building blocks only for foundations**  
  Methods sections may reference Sections 1–4, not each other.
- **Loose sequence**  
  TOC shows a suggested order, but every section must work standalone.

For full templates and examples, see CONTENT_DETAILS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## 3. Writing Style

- **Accessible, not patronising**  
  Clear explanations; assume intelligence, not prior statistical training.
- **Direct and practical**  
  Use imperative, present tense: “Calculate…”, “Check…”.
- **Honest about limitations**  
  State assumptions and what the method does *not* solve.
- **Second person, low textbook voice**  
  Use “you”. Avoid “as shown in Section X…”, prefer “see Section X for…”.

Detailed style rules and checklists: PROJECT_RULES.md and guidance.md (esp. quality criteria).

---

## 4. Code and Examples

- Examples must be **complete and runnable** (in both R and Python code).
- Use **CQC‑style data structures** and descriptive variable names.
- Each major method needs at least one **worked example** with:
  - Scenario
  - Data structure
  - Analysis steps with code
  - Output
  - Interpretation in regulatory context
  - QA documentation example

See CONTENT_DETAILS.md for required examples per section.

## 5. Scope for First Iteration

First iteration includes only:

- Foundations (Sections 1–4)
- Core methods:
  - Z‑scoring (Section 5 – highest priority)
  - SPC basics (Section 6)
  - t‑tests (Section 7)
- Appendices: Glossary + References

**Do NOT implement in iteration 1** (only reference if needed):
- Advanced missing‑data methods
- ANOVA, Chi‑squared, correlation tests
- Rules‑based methods as a standalone section
- Bayesian SPC and other advanced SPC topics (refer only in Overthinking)
- Dedicated “small numbers” section (handle briefly in Overthinking boxes)

Details and rationale: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and PLAN_SUMMARY.md.

## 6. Use of This Rules File

- Treat this file as the **source of truth for constraints** Windsurf must obey.
- For anything not specified here, consult:
  - guidance.md for principles
  - PROJECT_RULES.md for fuller standards
  - CONTENT_DETAILS.md for section‑level specs
  - QUARTO_CONFIG.md for technical config
  - QUICK_START.md for setup and file structure
