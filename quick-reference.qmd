## By Data Type and Sample Size

**Choose your method based on what you're measuring and how much data you have:**

| Data Type | Sample Size | Comparison Type | Recommended Method | Chapter |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Continuous** | Any | Single provider vs benchmark | Z-scoring | [@sec-z-scoring] |
| **Continuous** | Any | Many providers vs benchmark | Z-scoring | [@sec-z-scoring] |
| **Continuous** | ≥30 per group | Two groups | t-test (independent) | [@sec-t-tests] |
| **Continuous** | ≥30 pairs | Before/after (paired) | t-test (paired) | [@sec-t-tests] |
| **Continuous** | Time series | Trend detection | SPC (I-chart) | [@sec-spc-basics] |
| **Continuous** | ≥30 | Relationship between variables | Correlation | [@sec-correlation] |
| **Counts** | Time series | Trend detection | SPC (C-chart, U-chart) | [@sec-spc-basics] |
| **Counts** | ≥100 total | vs benchmark | Z-scoring (with continuity correction) | [@sec-z-scoring] |
| **Proportions** | ≥100 total | vs benchmark | Z-scoring | [@sec-z-scoring] |
| **Proportions** | Time series | Trend detection | SPC (P-chart) | [@sec-spc-basics] |
| **Binary** | ≥100 total | Two groups | t-test on proportions | [@sec-t-tests] |
| **Ordinal** | Any | Any | Consult Guild (specialized methods) | - |
| **Nominal** | Any | Group comparisons | Consult Guild (Chi-squared, etc.) | - |

**Notes:**
- Sample sizes are guidelines, not rigid thresholds. See individual method chapters for detailed requirements.
- For small samples (<30), consult [@sec-statistical-inference] and consider Guild support.
- For very small numbers (<5 events), see Overthinking boxes in method chapters.

**See [@sec-data-types] for detailed guidance on identifying and working with different data types.**

## Common Workflows

::: {style="padding: 1em; background-color: #f7fafc; border-left: 3px solid #e53e3e;"}
**Profile Provider Performance**

1. Check data quality and data type ([@sec-data-types])
2. Explore distributions ([@sec-describing-data], [@sec-variation-uncertainty], [@sec-distribution-shape])
3. Apply z-scoring ([@sec-z-scoring])
4. Investigate unusual observations ([@sec-unusual-observations], [@sec-outlier-methods])
5. Document methods, assumptions, and limitations

::: {style="padding: 1em; background-color: #f7fafc; border-left: 3px solid #3182ce;"}
**Evaluate Intervention or Policy Change**

1. Check data quality, data type, and baseline comparability ([@sec-data-types])
2. Understand statistical inference principles ([@sec-statistical-inference])
3. Assess assumptions (normality, equal variance)
4. Apply paired or two-sample t-test ([@sec-t-tests])
5. Report effect size, confidence interval, and p-value
6. Interpret in context (practical vs statistical significance)
7. Document for QA review

**Monitor Trends and Detect Changes**

1. Check data quality, data type, and temporal completeness ([@sec-data-types])
2. Understand variation ([@sec-variation-uncertainty]) and common vs special cause
3. Select appropriate chart type based on data type ([@sec-spc-basics])
4. Create SPC chart with control limits
5. Identify special cause signals (rules-based or visual)
6. Investigate flagged periods (root cause, context)
7. Update baselines when sustained changes confirmed

## Quick Decision Tree

::: {style="background-color: #edf2f7; padding: 1.5em; border-radius: 5px; margin: 1em 0;"}
**Step 1: What are you comparing?**

- **Single value vs benchmark** → Z-scoring [@sec-z-scoring]
- **Many values vs benchmark** → Z-scoring [@sec-z-scoring]
- **Time series (one provider over time)** → SPC [@sec-spc-basics]
- **Two groups** → t-test [@sec-t-tests]
- **Two variables (relationship)** → Correlation [@sec-correlation]
- **Nothing (just investigating unusual values)** → Outlier Methods [@sec-outlier-methods]

**Step 2: Check your data** (do this BEFORE analysis)

1. **Data type** → [@sec-data-types] (continuous, counts, proportions?)
2. **Quality checks** → [@sec-qa-principles] (errors, outliers, missing data)
3. **Distribution** → [@sec-describing-data], [@sec-distribution-shape] (shape, skewness)
4. **Sample size** → [@sec-statistical-inference] (enough data for method?)

**Step 3: Run analysis**

- Go to relevant method chapter (see table above)
- Follow step-by-step guide
- Check assumptions
- Interpret in context

**Step 4: Document** → [@sec-qa-principles]

- Methods used and why
- Assumptions checked
- Limitations and caveats
- Interpretation for decision-makers

**Throughout**: Check for unusual observations ([@sec-unusual-observations]), assess missing data ([@sec-missing-data-foundations]), verify assumptions, document decisions.

**Key principles**: Check data quality first • Match method to question • Report completely (n, effect size, CI, limits) • Document decisions • Statistical ≠ practical significance
